# Frontend Nanodegree Feedreader

This is a basic RSS feedreader project from the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree. You can look at this project on my github.io site [here](http://bdirgo.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader)

The feedreader project did not have any tests written for it when I forked this. I worte all of the test except for the first one. which was provided by Udacity.

The toughest part was getting the asynchronous calls to the rss feeds to work with the testing framework. The final test needs callbacks inside callbacks to get the correct values tested.
